Here is the workflow to calculate the heterozygosity per base pair per chromosome per sample and use plink to detect runs of homozygosity per sample.
The workflow outputs csv files.
These csv files are needed to create figure 2.
The functions called in the workflow.py file are found in templates.p
The packages needed for the workflow are in the primate_stats.yaml
The scripts associated with the template rules are here as well.
